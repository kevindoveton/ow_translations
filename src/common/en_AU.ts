Four types of data that can be uploaded: (i) depth to groundwater level, (ii) rainfall amount, (iii) checkdam water level and (iv) water quality parameters. Groundwater is an invisible resource and the data collected through this app can help us to visualise this vital resource and make more informed decisions about groundwater use and sharing.</p><p>The app was developed in the <a href='http://www.marvi.org.in/home'>MARVI project</a> and designed to assist volunteers, called Bhujal Jaankaar (Hindi word meaning 'groundwater informed') to report data for online storage and easy access to anyone who need for groundwater management.  The app displays the current status of the groundwater level in wells, together with rainfall amounts, checkdam water levels and water quality parameter values for simple comparison and analysis.</p><p>The groundwater level fluctuation over time, alongwith rainfall and check dam water level data, can be used to estimate groundwater recharge following rainfall events. The estimation of recharge can help in planning for the cropped area in the next season and cooperative management of groundwater.</p><p>In general, MyWell is an important tool for crowdsourcing data and can be used by anyone who is interested to monitor local groundwater levels and other parameters and want to share those data publicly for non-commercial purposes.  The app was developed for monitoring groundwater and other parameters in rural catchments but it is equally useful in urban and peri-urban catchments.</p><p>Thanks to the following individuals for their valuable input and support during the development of the app:</p><p>Dr P.
